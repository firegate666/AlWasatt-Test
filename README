****************************
* Al Wasatt Interview Test *
****************************

Introduction
============

This project contains two symfony modules, one for each test given, namely: Dice (test 1) and Game (test 2).
Since I'm new to Symfony, it took me a little while to put together a decent working demo. 


System Requirements
===================

- PHP v5.3
- Nginx or Apache 
- Symfony v1.4
- PHP Session


Web Server Setup
================

I've developed this project using Nginx (v1.0.11) web server. You may install Nginx on Ubuntu (debian) linux machine as:
sudo apt-get install nginx

Following configuration will help you run the code using Nginx web server.
(file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf)

# start-of: al-wasatt symfony config
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name local.dev.com;
    root /home/waseem/projects/alwasatt/web;

    # strip app.php/ prefix if it is present
    # production: rewrite ^/app\.php/?(.*)$ /$1 permanent;
    rewrite ^/frontend_dev\.php/?(.*)$ /$1 permanent;

    location / {
        # production: index app.php;
        index frontend_dev.php;
        try_files $uri @rewriteapp;
    }

    location @rewriteapp {
        # production: rewrite ^(.*)$ /app.php/$1 last;
        rewrite ^(.*)$ /frontend_dev.php/$1 last;
    }

    location ^~ /sf/ {
        alias /home/waseem/projects/alwasatt/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf/;
    }

    # pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000
    # production: location ~ ^/app\.php(/|$) {
    location ~ ^/frontend_dev\.php(/|$) {
        fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.*)$;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME    $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param  HTTPS              off;
    }
}
# end-of: al-wasatt test symfony config


Assumptions
===========

Test 1 - Dice (url: /dice)
--------------------------

1, Number of turns must be an integer
2, Familiarity of scoring algorithm


Test 2 - Game (url: /game)
--------------------------

1, Non-empty player name is expected
2, Unique player name help in identifying the player uniquely
3, Familiarity of game work flow & scoring algorithm
4, Game played in single PHP session (standard php.ini session setting assumed)


Code Review Instructions
========================

Following are few principles I follow personally while writing any code. Familiarity to these might help you in understanding the code with ease.

a, Object Oriented (OO)
b, Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
c, camelCasing
d, Function is private unless needed beyond file / class scope
e, Every function does a very specific job in a class.
f, Business logic should be kept as close-by as possible, ideally in one function or a class (such as controller).
g, Fluent code interface
h, Using 'dl', 'dt', and 'dt' over 'ul' / 'li' or 'table' HTML tags for rendering forms


Time sheet
==========
Hereunder is my time-sheet for the project:

Total: 16 hrs
Coding: ~ 4 hrs
Learning, documentation, testing, and deployment: ~ 12 hrs
